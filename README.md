## Windows 10 Installation
#### 1. Install PHP ([Video Guidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW0B9NTId2g))
  - Ignore if PHP is already installed
  - Go to https://windows.php.net/download#php-7.3 and download the zip file under **VC15 x64 Thread Safe**, or just click on this [link](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-7.3.29-Win32-VC15-x64.zip) download the zip.
  - Extract the zip and copy the content to a new folder called PHP7.3
  - Then move the PHP7.3 folder to c:/
  - Inside PHP7.3 folder, rename the file `php.ini-development` to **php.ini**.
  - Next, open this php.ini file with any text editor and search for a word `;extension_dir` (just below the line `;on windows`) and remove the `;` from `;extension_dir`. In php.ini, a `;` means a comment.
  - Next search, for two lines `extension=pdo_sqlite` and `extension=sqlite3` and make sure they are uncommented.
  - Next, go to `this pc` (your computer where you can see all your drives) and make a `right click > click propeties > click 'Advanced system settings' > click on 'Environment Variables`. In the top section, try to find a variable called **Path**.
   Click on **Path** and then click on `edit` and then click on `new`. Here type `c:/PHP7.3` which location of the php folder. Click "OK" all the way.
  - Restart computer and open a command prompt and type `php -v`. If everything was done right, then we can see a response with php version.
  - There might be an error called `vcruntime140.dll was not found`. In this case, go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145. Download and install the redist file
  based on your system type e.g 32 or 64 bit. If wrong type was installed, then the error will still persist. After installation, the `php -v` command will show a response.
